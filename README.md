## Text Representation with Binary Trees

In text classification studies, textual materials are represented with the frequencies of the words. 

The following steps have been followed in this project

1. Build a BST with the key “Word”.
2. Suppose that the number of accesses to word in your tree is directly the frequency of the word given in the table.
Calculate Total Access Time in the tree you build in (1).
3. Suppose that the number of accesses to word in your tree is directly the frequency of the word given in the table. Construct a BT to keep these records in the main memory so as to minimize the total access time, where one time unit is the time taken to compare the key of a tree with the key searched!
4. Calculate Total Access Time in the tree you build in (3).
5. Discuss your results in (2) and (4).
